This run was cut a bit short due to chances of rainfall. My phase 4 training is not to a great start cause I missed the workout and long run. I am wondering if the red plan is too demanding for me. I think it could be a reason why I am more than willing to cancel run days. I hope I can get back on the right mindset.
