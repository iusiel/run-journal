Started phase 4 of the white plan. For this phase, I will adopt zone 2 training via the garmin watch. I hope that it will be effective. For this session, I noticed that I needed to take some walk breaks to maintain zone 2. I hope that it will improve in the future as I want to run continously without walk breaks while trying to maintain zone 2.
