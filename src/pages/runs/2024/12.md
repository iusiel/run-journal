I have decided to move on to the Phase 2 of the white plan by Jack Daniels. For some reason, it was not an easy run at all. I think I underestimated the workout. I also drank milk before going on a run to test things out. Looks like that is not a good decision at all. I'll try drinking milk again tomorrow to see if the milk is really the issue or not.
