This is another threshold session. It was supposed to be 6 x 1 km repeats, but I decided to settle in 5 since it was hotter than usual. I also did not want my run to exceed an hour. Maybe I'll change the structure of this workout so that it will not exceed an hour. It was draining but I think I was able to do it properly.
