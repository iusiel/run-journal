This was not a fun run at all. I felt uncomfortable throughout the run. That is why it came as a surprise when I managed to get a new 5K PB. Even though it was not fun, I was happy and satisfied with the result. That concludes the white plan for me. Overall, I had fun doing the white plan since it did not require that much effort and intensity. It was more reliant on accumulating mileage through easy runs. I will now be moving into the red plan for preparation in the next race that I am planning to participate which is the Hoka Trilogy Run Leg 3 at August.
