My plan for this session was to hold the pace of 6:00/km for the first 20 minutes of the workout and then finish the last 10 minutes with a pace of 5:00/km. Currently, I am targeting 50 minutes for my 10k time trial. Unfortunately, I had trouble holding the 6:00/km pace. I was only able to sustain it during the first kilometer and later on I was just not able to hold. I am not sure if it is due to a lack of preparation on my part or because I don't have the ability right now to hold 6:00/km for a sustained period. Anyway, this was a workout I did not enjoy at all. I lost confidence that I could achieve a 50-minute 10k or even one hour. I am planning to rethink my race strategy for my upcoming 10k time trial. Fortunately, I did not experience any niggles or any minor issues.
