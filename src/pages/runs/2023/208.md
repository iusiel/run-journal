I tried some walk/run exercise today to test if my injured ankle has healed. This session consisted of a 5-minute walk, 10x 1-minute walk / 1-minute run, and then another 5-minute walk. I was able to finish it though I felt some discomfort on my ankle. I am not sure if it is because it has not healed fully or because I stopped running for about a month. I think it is because I have stopped running for a while. I do not feel any discomfort while doing my long walks. I think I'll run again this Saturday.
