This is my first time doing this type of run, tackling zone 2, zone 3, zone 4 and zone 5. It was a pretty hard workout but I managed to hit the paces required except for zone 4. It looks like I can't hold my calculated zone 4 pace for 3 minutes regularly. It was tiring, but I am pretty proud that I managed to finish this workout. It looks like I did not have any unnecessary tiredness as I was still able to work properly today.

My next big workout will be this coming Saturday which will be a 10-mile (16km) long run using zone 2 and zone 3 paces.
