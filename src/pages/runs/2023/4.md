I decided to do a 5K time trial to check my current fitness. As expected, this was quite a hard run for me. It also did not help that I run using my worn-out Accel shoes. At this point, this time trial gave me all the motivation that I wanted since I lost quite an amount of fitness due to not exercising regularly.
