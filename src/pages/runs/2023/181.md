For the remaining two months of the year, I have decided to not follow any specific training plan. What I am aiming right now is to reach a certain monthly mileage. I was thinking thay maybe I can target 100-120 kms per month for this specific training period. I decided to not follow any plan for now because I want to focus on "base training". I think the general structure that I am thinking is a threshold run for the first run, easy run for the second run and a long run for the final run of the week. I think I will also mix some walking or recovery runs to increase mileage.
<br/><br/>
As for the run I did today, I did not enjoy it. I think that it may be due to lack of sleep. I think the hilly course that I ran also did not help. Nonetheless, I am satisfied with the result for this one. I think I am going to easy on myself for this week and then ramp up the training starting next week.
<br/><br/>
I also dedicated two days to run two time trial events for myself so that I can have something to look forward to. The first is a 1km time trial on December 24 and the second one is a 5k time trial on December 31. I specifically targetted Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve because I want to experience what it's like to run before a holiday. I think nothing special will happen though.
