I tried to pace myself as much as possible during the easy run so that I will have lots of energy left for the zone 3 finish. I was able to do the zone 3 finish in the pace describe (6:30) but I needed to do some walk breaks in order to accomplish. Overall I am happy with my run. I did not notice any niggles. I am just somewhat tired so no heavy activities for me after this run.
