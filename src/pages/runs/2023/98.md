To be honest, I was not confident that I would be able to reach my goal of 2:30:00 since the last few weeks of my training did not go well. During the race, I was surprised that the first 14 km relatively went well. I did not feel any pain or any slowing down at all. The last 5 km did not go as well as I hoped. I was able to maintain pace by doing a run/walk combination. My watch recorded 2:30:29. My gun time was 02:29:43 while my chip time was 02:28:56. Overall, I was glad with how the race went. My next target event will be a 10K time trial.
