Final long run before my 10k time trial. The original plan called for 8 miles of mixed zone 2 and zone 3 running, but I decided to cut it back to 5 miles so that my long would not be too long. It was tiring since I had to switch between zone 2 and zone 3. I am not sure if I could have all 8 miles if I tried to. Nonetheless, I am proud of my effort here. Next week will focus on taper and refining my race day strategy. Fortunately, I did not suffer any injuries nor did I feel any niggles.
