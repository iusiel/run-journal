Everything was going well for this session until the final seconds of my last rep. I rolled my ankle pretty hard. I was pretty frustrated because I was just seconds away from cooldown. I was able to finish the workout overall (maybe due to adrenaline). I can feel some pain in the rolled ankle. I'll check if I should proceed with my next runs or just play it safe and let it heal.
